# elona_server
Replacement chat server for [Elona](http://homepage3.nifty.com/rfish/index_e.html) and [Elona+](http://wikiwiki.jp/elonaplus/?FrontPage).

The list of servers is hardcoded, so an official update/patch to decompiled HSP would have to be made.

If the game is started with no Internet connection, the servers listed in the "servers.txt" file in the game directory will be used. This is the only real way to test the server for now.
