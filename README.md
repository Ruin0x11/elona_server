# elona_server
Replacement chat server for [Elona](http://ylvania.org/en/elona) and [Elona+](http://wikiwiki.jp/elonaplus/?FrontPage).

The list of servers is hardcoded, so an official update/patch to decompiled HSP would have to be made.

If the `serverList` option in the "config.txt" file is set to `1` or the game is started with no Internet connection, the servers listed in the "server.txt" file in the game directory will be used.
